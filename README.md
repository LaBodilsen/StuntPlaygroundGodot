# StuntPlaygroundGodot
Godot port/remake of Stunt Playground.

Original game by [Walaber](http://www.walaber.com), source code here: https://github.com/jonri/StuntPlayground

Follow development of this project on the [Godot forums](https://godotforums.org/discussion/19168/stunt-playground)

The main purposes of this project are to learn Godot, beat on its physics engine, and hopefully provide good example design/code for the parts that work well.  It's also fun to play :-)

### Controls
* Arrow keys - drive
* Spacebar - handbrake
* R - flip back over
